# Email Spam Detection

## Introduction
Email spam detection is a machine learning project aimed at classifying emails as spam or ham (not spam). This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to detect spam emails based on their content.

## Features
- Preprocessing of email text (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, etc.)
- Feature extraction using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings
- Classification using machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Deep Learning models
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Installation
To set up the project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing labeled emails as spam or ham. You can use publicly available datasets such as:
- [SpamAssassin Public Corpus](https://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/)
- [Kaggle SMS Spam Collection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

## Usage
1. Preprocess the dataset
2. Extract features from the text
3. Train a classification model
4. Evaluate the model on test data
5. Use the model for spam prediction

Example:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

def predict_spam(email_text, model):
    return model.predict([email_text])
```

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of correctly identified spam emails.
- **Recall**: Measures how many actual spam emails were correctly identified.
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Future Improvements
- Use deep learning models such as LSTMs for better accuracy.
- Implement real-time spam filtering in email applications.
- Integrate with cloud-based APIs for scalability.
